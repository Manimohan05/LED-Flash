# LED-Flash
1 IDENTIFICATION OF THE PRODUCT

I have selected Portable LED Flash. This is the product that I am going to implement at
the end of the semester for the module EN2160. I have considered products (<$50) available
in marketing platforms.
This 12V Portable LED Flash initially designs to avoid interruption due to power failures.
The key reason to build this Portable LED Flash is to get continuous light during power
failures. This is able to act as a mobile power bank and router backup as well

1.1 Problem Description

There are lots of issues due to power failures. If we need to continue everything we need a
stable and continuous light. So we need a continuous power supply. furthermore I wish to
build it as backup for routers as well. Because, After Covid-19 lot of companies switched to
work-from-home. At the same time education system of Srilanka(Worldwide also) also moved
to online mode.

1.2 Problem validation

For the above problem, We can have a rechargeable bulb but the main issue is, sometime
we need connect the power bank to the mobile or backup for the router. Therefore, If we
designed Portable LED Flash then we can overcome the following issues.
1. Even though we have a rechargeable bulb, sometime It may be fixed at a location
2. Even though we have a rechargeable bulb, Its active time may be small.
3. We don’t need to buy 3 things such as rechargeable bulb, power-bank for mobile and
backup for router
I hope the above things validate my problem Then I read a lot of surveys and blogs. There
are a lot of questions and requests asked during the power cut.

1.3 Motivation for selection

I am also an undergraduate. I also suffered due to power failure and I also didn’t connect to
the Online classes properly in my semester 1. The main reason is even though rechargeable
bulbs didn’t provide light for the entire day’s lectures and I have the Fibre network connection
due to a power cut automatically router also came off after that, I heard about the Portable
LED Flash with a power bank. That was my own past experience. That motivated me to
design this with some extra features.

1.4 Solutions

This 12V Portable LED Flash initially designs to get continuous light. It can provide constant
light power for at least 12 hours. At the same time, we can use it when it’s connected to
230V also. If connect it to the power supply and on the switch It will work automatically
when power fails and it will provide the directly regulated voltage rest of the time.

1.5 Innovative Rating

My system is an improved model. There already exists a system, which is mini ups without
display and it can provide power for 2 hours. I expect to make a system with a display, which
can display the charge going from ups or direct power supply. Then if it’s from ups then it
will show the percentage of charge remaining in the power bank. And planned to make it,
which able to provide power for approximately 7 hours.

1.6 Constrains

I have listed out the constraints, I got during analyzation and selection of this product The
constraints are :
* It is risky to handle with 230V
* Its price is approximately 12,500 LKR (50$) in Ali Express. But If we designed only one
product. Then we need to have more than 15,000 LKR.
* There maybe hardness when finding a rechargeable battery that can provide a charge for
12 hours.
  
1.7 Reasoning

I have analyzed the available Portable LED Flash. Personally, I felt from my past experiences,
if the above innovative ratings will be included, then It will be better than others. I have
a little bit checked about the feasibility. That’s why I have identified this product as my
EN2160 - Electronic Design Realization project.
